Welcome! I’m starting this blog to document my homelab builds (Proxmox, OPNsense, VLANs…), exam prep (Security+, CySA+), and practical blue-team skills.

## What I’ll cover
- Network segmentation with VLANs (IoT vs LAN)
- WireGuard and site-to-site concepts
- Logs that actually matter for tier-1 SOC
- Study notes and cheat sheets

## Why this matters
I’m tracking projects that directly translate to SOC analyst skills—alert triage, packet/flow basics, detection mindset, and reporting.
