This lab is where I will start my journey in demonstrating my knowlege and gaining more knowlege for networking and network security. My goal is to be able to create a secure enviornment in my home and eventually figure out how to break it then eventually fix it again. This is a great project that has no limits and can constatnly grow with my knowlege. 

My setup on the date of October/6/2025 is a 

[[Hitron cable modem]] (I believed I had an all in one cable/router combo from my  ISP so I purchased this to cut the routing connection from that modem completely to enhance security, turns out I don't and I never really needed this but its better to have your own equipment anyways. )

[[GMK Tech Mini PC (router) ]]There were alot of options for a router, however a friend of mine had recommended this to me from his own home lab setup so I figured it'll be easier to troubleshoot with him rather than a different machine. However this machine can be changed for a more secure option in the future, considering GMKtec is a chinese company I am not sure the threat that might pose to my networks security. 

[[Tp-link 8 port switch]]- In the future I'd like to upgrade to a cisco catalyst  managed switch to  dive into network segmentation and vlans. 

[[TP Link Omada  WAP]]- this is to give wifi connection to the house.
