To set this up its fairly simple, modems are the device that connects your home network to your ISP, my modem is connected by a Coaxial cable. 

To configure my new modem I had to do rewire my old coaxial cable into my office where I will be setting up my homelab. So I took my coaxial cable from my ISP, cut it and ran it into the wall that connects into my office, I used an F-Type connecter and a Coax compression tool to connect them together then I tested it with my old modem to test for functionality and it works.

Next step is to call my ISP to connect my new modem. 

I called spectrum and provided them with the mac address of the modem, then I got it connected. I made sure the internet is up with the old router then now I'm going to configure the new router,
