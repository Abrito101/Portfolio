My Main desktop is a gaming PC that I built with a 

CPU: Ryzen 7 9800x 3D 8 core processor  
GPU: 5070 Ventus 2X
Ram: 32 GB of Corsair Ventus Ram 

This machine packs alot of power, building this myself has given me the knowledge of trouble shooting and understanding the functoins of basic computer components. Its taught me best practices to create a safe and reliable machine and keep logging and metrics of my systems performance. 

This desktop will be the command and control center, where I will be doing most of my work, connecting to my virtual environments from and what I will be using to perform penetration tests and store my logging information.
