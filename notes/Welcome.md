Home Lab setup 


Home labbing has been a big interest of mine since I've strarted my cybersecurity journey. Home labbing is a practical way to learn the fundamentals of networking, security and hardware configuration. 

During this journey I want to dive deeper into hardware configuration, basic and advanced networking, diving into network segmentation, Virtual Lans, and more. I want to dive into security setting up firewalls and rules and dive deeper into monitoring, privelage separation, and host mock penetration tests. 

I want to test my college and military education aswell as my security+ certification against my homelab, demostrating my knowlege in a practical setting. 

My set up will consist of
